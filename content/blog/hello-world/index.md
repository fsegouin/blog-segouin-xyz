description: "Yet another blog? Why not."

It feels weird starting yet another blog from scratch. I have a very good backup policy when it comes to my photos that I seem to value more than what I wrote in the past.
Hopefully this one will survive longer than others did.

Please don't expect too much from this blog, I'm awful at sitting in front of a computer to write down things.
However, these past few months, I've been busy building a few things that I think I should share, because my past self would have loved to read about this. I guess this is why we write blogs, don't we? 

Stay tuned for more ~exciting~ posts.
